# INR Lab 5 - BGP

#### Artem Abramov SNE19



## 1. Preparation

### a. Select a virtual routing solution that you would like to try. For example (Mikrotik, vyos, Pfsense).

I decided to select MikroTik.

### b. GNS3 already have a template for these routers (Mikrotik, vyos, Pfsense), try to use these templates as it will save you a lot of time and troubleshooting.

I decided to select MikroTik.

### c. Try to draw a network scheme before you start the lab. This will help you in the deployment phase. 

### d. The network scheme should include at least two networks, each one of them should have at least 3 routers, these routers can be the same routers from OSPF lab.

Below is the topology of my network:

![Selection_333](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/Selection_333.png)

### e. This lab should be done in teams of 2, 3 or 4. As long as each team member uses a different network device

While doing the task I paired with different people at different times (because sometime my teammate was not in lab). Most often I paired with Ali (Cisco) and sometimes with Rodrigo (Cisco) or Gaspar (MikroTik) to verify my configuration.

### f. Connect one of your OSPF ASBR router interfaces (BGP interface) to your physical interface (bridge can also be used)

My BGP router is `routerb` and its `ether4` is connected to my physical interface (via the `Cloud-1`) as shown on the topology diagam above. 

### g. Agree with other teams on a subnet that your team will use, Beware 503b, KUI and 209 are on the same VLAN. Currently only uses 10.1.1.0/24. 

The IP used for `ether4` interface on my BGP `routerb` is `10.1.1.1`. Every GBP router was given an address from the range 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.12. To configure the IP address on my ether4 interface I used the command below:

```
[admin@MikroTik] > ip address add address=10.1.1.1/24 interface=ether4
```



### h. Check that you can ping your teammates ASBR router from your ASBR router

## 2. Deployment

During deployment I configured the second area. This process was essentially the same as described in INR Lab 4 - OSPF. Therefore I will just list the final configuration files, for brevity. 

Configuration for `routere` is shown below:

![routere_345](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/routere_345.png)



The configuration for `routerf` is shown below:

![routerf_346](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/routerf_346.png)



The configuration for `routerg` is shown below:

![routerg_347](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/routerg_347.png)



Configuring the client `PC-6` in `Area 1` and pinging the adjacent router is shown below:

![PC-6_348](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/PC-6_348.png)



The next step is configuring OSPF and setting the area to  `Area 1` on the new routers in Area 1.

Configuration of loopback and OSPF RouterID for `routere`:

![routere_349](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/routere_349.png)



Similarly for two other routers: `routerf` is `10.255.255.6` and `routerg` is `10.255.255.7`.

To configure the area1 on the `routere` I used the commands below:

![routere_350](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/routere_350.png)

Then I configured all three routers to be part of area1 as shown below:
```
[admin@MikroTik] > routing ospf network add network=0.0.0.0/0 area=area1
```

Then the same area had to be configured on `routerb`.

### Define an AS number that your ASBR router will use, again agree with the other teams on which AS number each team will use (64512 to 65534)

I choose AS number `65532`, Ali for example had `65528`.

I configured my AS number in my BGP config as shown below (this is my ASBR router - `routerb`):

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_339.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_339](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_339.png)


### Enable BGP and start advertising your OSPF network to your peer.


To set up the connection between my and Rodrigo's routers I added his AS number `65531` and ASBR router IP `10.1.1.9` to my BGP config as shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_336.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_336](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_336.png)


Until Rodrigo added my network to his BGP config it looked as below (the screenshot below is me adding Gaspar to my BGP config, but it shows the status):

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_323.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_323](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_323.png)

Then Rodrigo similarly added my AS number `65532` and my ASBR IP `10.1.1.1` to his BGP config. I could see that he acknowledged my AS as shown below (also shown are Ali's and Gaspar's networks):

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_338.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_338](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_338.png)



The same information is shown 

![routerb_340](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/routerb_340.png)



At this moment we had a couple of network conflicts that were solved by changing IP subnets. Luckily my subnets did not conflict with anyone.

### c. Can your peers reach your internal subnets? And can you reach their internal subnets?

Pinging and traceroute to an internal IP on Rodrigo's subnet is shown below:

![QEMU (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/QEMU%20(client1)%20-%20TigerVNC_337.png) - TigerVNC_337](../../../Pictures/QEMU%20(client1)%20-%20TigerVNC_337.png)



To check that my network is reachable from Rodrigo's network I asked him to ping my internal machine `client3` (with ip address  `10.0.3.3` ) from his internal machine as shown below:

![](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/photo_2019-09-23_21-52-13.jpg)



For this to work I turned on the option to redistribute OSPF routes via BGP as shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_339-1569267883042.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_339](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_339.png)



### d. How can the OSPF Internal router know about your peerâ€™s OSPF Internal router? One way is to redistribute BGP routes into the OSPF routing table, but is this a practical method? why?

I used the option to redistribute BGP routes into OSPF and furthermore the option to redistribute "Other OSPF Router". This option was turend on on `routerb` which is the ASBR.  This is reflected in the OSPF configuration as shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_342.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_342](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_342.png)

Also this worked because Ali turned on the ability to distribute their OSPF routes outside of their AS. 

This method is in fact not very practical, because it requires that every router knows about all routes. This means that routers need better hardware capabilities to keep up with changes in the network (when some routes are changed, the new information must be parsed and stored). Furthermore it floods the network excessively. A better solution would be to configure route summarization and distribute that information. This requires extra work on the network administrator part and must be kept up to date, but can provide advantageous in big networks.




## 3. Verification

### a. How can you check if you have an established status with your peer?

This is shown on the BGP configuration panel as shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_343.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_343](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_343.png)



### b. How can you check in the routing table of ASBE and OSPF Internal router to see which networks did you receive from your neighbors?

To check which network I have received via the BGP protocol I can see in the configuration window as shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_344.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_344](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_344.png)



Here Ali acts as the transit network so he advertises all the possible routes. The AS Path column is also interesting, it reflects that there are actually some unresolved subnetwork conflicts (i.e. same networks in different AS), because there are just too many routes to a particular destination (via too many different ASes). Also Ali is connected to multiple other networks therefore he has so many routes to advertise.



The network routes from an OSPF internal router -  `routerc` is shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.222 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.222%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_351.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_351](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.222%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_351.png)





## 4. Transit

### a. Peer with other teams and send them the routers that you receive from your peer in task 2

I enabled redistributing other BGP routes as shown below:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_356.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_356](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_356.png)



To peer with other team I just added one of their members to my BGP peers list. For my case I used Rustam. Added him to my list as below (ip `10.1.1.12`, area `65532`):

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_353.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_353](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_353.png)



In turn Rustam added me an the connection was established:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_354.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_354](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_354.png)



I have received his routes:

![admin@192.168.122.139 (INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_355.png) - WinBox v6.44.2 on CHR (x86_64)_355](../../../Pictures/admin@192.168.122.139%20(MikroTik)%20-%20WinBox%20v6.44.2%20on%20CHR%20(x86_64)_355.png)



Similarly Rustam could see my network and recognize it as a gateway:

![](INR-Lab-5-bgp.assets/photo_2019-09-24_01-03-29.jpg)



### b. Can the new peer reach your network and your teammate network through you?

Unfortunately Rustam was not available to complete this part of the lab with me, so I continued with Rodrigo.

We checked that Rodrigo could ping Ali. Routes were distributed correctly :
